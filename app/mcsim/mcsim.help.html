<h1>MC Sim</h1>
<p>This program was created in 2016 on the basis and with the command set of a Windows 8.1 Desktop micro controller simulator
    which was used at the BBZW Sursee, Switzerland. As this simulator had issues running on some windows 10 systems,
    this program was created for the test preparation.
</p>
<p>Many things are configurable, but there is only one finished command set until now because the class moved on to
    the much more complicated x86 assembler after the above mentioned test. For more command sets, open an issue on
    <a href="http://github.com/lukee910/homepage">GitHub</a> and I'll help where I can.
</p>
<h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
<p>A small set of keyboard shortcuts are supported for the program editor. All these shortcuts only work while the
    editor text field is focused.
